# Enumerable-methods-in-Ruby

This project is all about implementing some of Ruby's Enumerable Module methods.
Methods implemented are the #each(#my_each), #each_with_index(#each_with_index)
,#select(#my_select), #all?(#my_all?), #any?(#my_any?),#none?(#my_none?)
,#count(#my_count), #map(#my_map), and #inject(#my_inject).

The #my_inject method was also tested in another method called #multiply_els.
Although not required in the project, the Test Driven Development approach was
used here to test the methods that were implemented. The reason for using this
approach is for me to have a better understand of RSpec, the terminologies and
how to write test efficiently.

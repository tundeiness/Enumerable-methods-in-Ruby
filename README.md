# Enumerable-methods-in-Ruby

This project is all about implementing some of Ruby's Enumerable Module methods.
Methods implemented are the:

* #each(#my_each),
* #each_with_index(#each_with_index),
* #select(#my_select),
* #all?(#my_all?),
* #any?(#my_any?),
* #none?(#my_none?),
* #count(#my_count),
* #map(#my_map), and
* #inject(#my_inject).

The #my_inject method was also tested in another method called #multiply_els.
